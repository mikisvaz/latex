    abstract  = {In the last few years, advances in high-throughput
technologies are generating large amounts of biological data that require
analysis and interpretation. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been
established as a very effective method to reveal information about the complex
latent relationships in experimental data sets. Using this method as part of
the exploratory data analysis, workflow would certainly help in the process of
interpreting and understanding the complex biology mechanisms that are
underlying experimental data. We have developed bioNMF, a web-based tool that
implements the NMF methodology in different analysis contexts to support some
of the most important reported applications in biology. This online tool
provides a user-friendly interface, combined with a computational efficient
parallel implementation of the NMF methods to explore the data in different
analysis scenarios. In addition to the online access, bioNMF also provides the
same functionality included in the website as a public web services interface,
enabling users with more computer expertise to launch jobs into bioNMF server
from their own scripts and workflows. bioNMF application is freely available

    abstract = {Here we perform whole-exome sequencing of samples from 105 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia {(CLL)}, the most frequent leukemia in adults in Western countries. We found 1,246 somatic mutations potentially affecting gene function and identified 78 genes with predicted functional alterations in more than one tumor sample. Among these genes, {SF3B1}, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein {(snRNP)}, is somatically mutated in 9.7\% of affected individuals. Further analysis in 279 individuals with {CLL} showed that {SF3B1} mutations were associated with faster disease progression and poor overall survival. This work provides the first comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in {CLL} with relevant clinical correlates and defines a large set of new genes that may drive the development of this common form of leukemia. The results reinforce the idea that targeting several well-known genetic pathways, including {mRNA} splicing, could be useful in the treatment of {CLL} and other malignancies.},

    Abstract={Genomic information on tumors from 50 cancer types cataloged by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) shows that only a few well-studied driver genes are frequently mutated, in contrast to many infrequently mutated genes that may also contribute to tumor biology. Hence there has been large interest in developing pathway and network analysis methods that group genes and illuminate the processes involved. We provide an overview of these analysis techniques and show where they guide mechanistic and translational investigations.}
